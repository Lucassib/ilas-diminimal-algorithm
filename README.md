# ilas-diminimal-algorithm
This is the repository of the application running at https://lucassib-ilas-diminimal-algorithm-st-app-6y8gj9.streamlit.app/.

The goal of this application is to be a simulator of the work entitled "Generating acyclic symmetric matrices with the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues". 

In this application, the user starts with a seed and can perform s-duplications at will, so that the generated tree $T_i$ will be displayed on the screen along with its spectrum. 

Select the input parameters in the left menu of Algorithm and click on "Set Parameters". After that move to the tab "Algorithm". 

Below the displayed tree, choose a vertex for its branch to be duplicated (the user can look up its number in the figure above) and the number of duplications for that branch. Click on "Perform s-duplication" in the desired branch.

Once some tree have been displayed, the user can choose the tree layout in the left menu and view the matrix of that tree.
